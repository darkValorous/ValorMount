ValorMount

A simple addon just for mounting up.

Features:
 - Can be called with a key binding or a macro.
 - Easy to set favorites - it just uses the Mount Journal.
 - Option to save different favorites per character in the Mount Journal.
 - By default, it will avoid using Flying Mounts when you can't fly.
 - Each flying favorite can be toggled to be used for both air and ground, or even ground only.
 - Ability to override how the addon determines if the current area allows flying or not.

Race/Class Specific Features
 - Monks have the option of Zen Flight if used while moving or falling.
 - Shamans have the option of Ghost Wolf if used while moving or in combat.
 - Druids will shapeshift to Travel Form if used in any situation you cannot normally mount (eg. while moving)
 - Druids can toggle to ONLY use Flight Form for flying, or to include Flight Form as part of its random selection.
 - Balance Druids can enable automatically returning to Moonkin form when shifting from Travel Form.
 - Worgens can add Running Wild into the random selection for ground mounts.
 - If the addon ValorWorgen is loaded, Worgens have the option of returning to Human Form when mounting.
